Introduction
============


In this documentation you will find step by step instructions on how to set up
the package, detailed description of its components and all necessary
information helpful in order to take full advantage of its functionalities.

However, since large number of image processing software is already available,
it is worth starting by clearly defining motivations behind :mod:`piva`,
together with its capabilities and limitations. This should give the user a
good overview of what aspects of the package may be helpful and how to
maximize its utility in conducted research/work.


What is :mod:`piva`
-------------------

:mod:`piva` is a GUI application based on :mod:`PyQt5` and :mod:`pyqtgraph`
toolkits, designed for interactive and intuitive examination of large,
image-like datasets. Although it is generally capable of displaying any data
being multidimensional arrays of numbers, vast majority of implemented
functionalities are intended for users performing Angle-Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (ARPES).

Package allows for *live* investigation of many different datasets
individually, as well as for linking separate datasets and browsing through
them simultaneously. By using interactive sliders one can cut and display
multidimensional data across all available directions (see :ref:`DataViewers
<sec-viewers>`). Next to many image processing methods it allows for presenting
ARPES images in momentum space and apply corrections specific to experimental
setup from which data were acquired.

Handful of utilities can be especially useful during the experiment phase,
*e.g.* automated methods for finding highest symmetry points and azimuthal
rotation or autogenerated experimental notebooks, implemented for :ref:`many
beamlines <sec-dl-list>` at different synchrotron sources.

Moreover, it introduces standardized data format used within the package,
overcoming issues with multiple formats spread across ARPES community. Proposed
format can be easily used outside of :mod:`piva` by importing
:ref:`data_loaders.py <sec-data-loaders-file>` module.

Finally, :ref:`Fitters <sec-fitters>` and :ref:`PlotTool <sec-plottool>`
applications contain additional functionalities allowing for detailed analysis
and personalized representation of acquired results.


What :mod:`piva` is not
-----------------------

In contrary to for example diffraction, discrepancies in ARPES results between
different physical systems require one to implement unique analysis methods
for virtually every investigated system. For that reason, :mod:`piva` does not
attempt to provide extensive tools for deep-analysis and its representation,
as in every case they would have to be adjusted to match specific needs of the
user.

Instead, it includes straightforward tools for exporting loaded datasets and
opening them with a ``jupyter-lab`` notebook, where one can perform more
sophisticated analysis, requiring hands-on scripting.


----

Summing up, :mod:`piva` provides a time efficient, intuitive GUI application
for examination of multiple datasets and is equipped with a platform for
importing data into convenient format. It is based on ``python`` and
``jupyter-lab`` environments, allowing one to easily carry on on with a
detailed analysis of obtained spectra.
