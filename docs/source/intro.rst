Introduction
============


In this documentation you will find step by step instructions on how to set up
the package, detailed description of its components and all necessary
information helpful in taking full advantage of its functionalities.

However, since large number of image processing software is already available,
it is worth to begin by clearly defining motivations behind :mod:`piva`,
together with its capabilities and limitations. This should give the user a
good overview of what aspects of the package may be helpful and how to
maximize its utility in a conducted research/work.


What is :mod:`piva`
-------------------

:mod:`piva` is a GUI application based on :mod:`PyQt5` and :mod:`pyqtgraph`
toolkits, designed for interactive and intuitive exploration of large,
image-like datasets. Although it is generally capable of displaying any
multidimensional data, vast majority of implemented functionalities are
geared towards users performing Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments.

Package allows for *live* investigation of many different datasets
individually, as well as for linking separate datasets and browsing through
them simultaneously. Interactive sliders allow one to display multidimensional
data across all available directions (see :ref:`DataViewers <sec-viewers>`).
Next to many image processing methods it allows representing ARPES images in
momentum space and apply corrections specific to experimental conditions at
which data were acquired.

Handful of utilities can be especially useful during the experiment phase,
*e.g.* automated methods for finding highest symmetry points, azimuthal
rotation or autogenerated experimental notebooks, implemented for :ref:`many
beamlines <sec-dl-list>` at different synchrotron sources around the world.

Moreover, it translates raw data into a standardized
:ref:`DataSet <sec-dataset>` object, overcoming issue of various data formats
spread across ARPES community. The :ref:`DataSet <sec-dataset>` can be easily
used outside of :mod:`piva` by simply importing
:ref:`data_loaders.py <sec-data-loaders-file>` module.

Finally, :ref:`Fitters <sec-fitters>` and :ref:`PlotTool <sec-plottool>`
applications contain additional functionalities allowing for detailed analysis
and personalized representation of acquired results.

The architecture of :mod:`piva` package was designed in the spirit of
modularity, providing users with a convenient platform for implementing custom
data loaders and interactive widgets/apps. Detailed description and examples on
how to configure new modules can be found in this documentation.

In contrary to other experimental techniques, discrepancies in ARPES results
between different physical systems require one to implement unique analysis
methods for virtually every investigated system. For that reason, :mod:`piva`
contains a generic toolkit for dealing with photoemission results, that can be
further tailored to match specific needs of the user. Moreover, it includes
straightforward tools for exporting loaded datasets and opening them with a
``jupyter-lab`` notebook, where one can perform more sophisticated analysis,
requiring hands-on scripting.


----

Summarizing, :mod:`piva` provides an efficient, intuitive GUI application
for examination of multiple datasets and is equipped with a platform for
importing data into a convenient format. It is based on ``python`` and
``jupyter-lab`` environments, allowing one to easily carry on their own
detailed analysis of the acquired data.
