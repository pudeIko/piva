## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. **Create a Conda Virtual Environment**:
   - Itâ€™s recommended to use a Conda virtual environment for managing 
   dependencies:
     ```bash
     conda create -n piva-env python=3.10.8
     conda activate piva-env
     ```

2. **Fork and Clone**:
   - Fork the repository by clicking the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of 
   the page.
   - Clone your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/pudeIko/piva.git
     cd piva
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -e .[test]
     ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Verify that the existing codebase works as expected:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

## Branching Model

For any new implementations or changes, simply open a new branch. Name your 
branch descriptively based on the type of contribution, *e.g.*:

- `feature/new-analysis-method`
- `bugfix/fix-interactive-ui`

---

## Submitting Your Contribution

When submitting a pull request:

- Ensure your code adheres to PEP 8 coding standards.
- Write clear commit messages describing the changes.
- Ensure your contribution includes appropriate documentation in 
docstrings and, if necessary, more detailed explanations in the project's 
documentation files.
- If applicable, write new tests for your changes.

---

## Testing Guidelines

We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests:

If you add new features, ensure they are covered by relevant test cases. 
Place tests in the `tests/` directory, following the existing structure.

---

## Issue Reporting

To report issues:

1. Check the Issues tab to see if the problem has already been reported.
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - A clear title and description.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Screenshots or code snippets, if applicable.
