# PIVA - Python Interactive Viewer for Arpes

PIVA is a GUI application based on `PyQt5` and `pyqtgraph` toolkits, designed 
for interactive and intuitive examination of large, image-like datasets. 
Although it is generally capable of displaying any multidimensional data, a 
vast majority of the implemented functionalities are geared towards users 
performing Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.

A number of standard methods and image processing algorithms 
(momentum-space conversion, energy distribution curve symmetrization and 
derivative analysis, *etc.*) are accessible from the GUI level. 
Moreover, handful of utilities can be especially useful during the experiment 
phase, when decision about next steps need to be taken on the fly. This 
includes automated methods for finding highest symmetry points, azimuthal 
rotation or autogenerated experimental notebooks, implemented for :ref:`many
beamlines <sec-dl-list>` at different synchrotron sources around the world.


## Installation 

The installation of PIVA has been tested on macOS, Windows and Linux.

The easiest way to install the package is to use `pip`. Just type the following 
on a command line:

    pip install piva

or directly from this repo:
